The netutil functions defined for `internal/util/netutil.go` will be POSIX-specific due to their reliance on concepts like FD_CLOEXEC and passing file descriptors across exec. If Windows support were ever a future requirement (though the current spec focuses on POSIX), these functions would need platform-specific implementations or stubs, likely managed with Go build tags (e.g., in files like `netutil_posix.go`, `netutil_windows.go`).
